# Scalaris framework

## Abstract
Scalaris is a novel framework designed to facilitate the rapid development of decentralized applications by leveraging advanced consensus protocols. Initially built on the cutting-edge research of Narwhal and Bullshark, Scalaris introduces a leaderless, parallel, high-throughput, scalable, and MEV-mitigation consensus mechanism. Additionally, we are exploring the integration of a new DAG-based and leaderless consensus protocol called Mysticeti, which promises a throughput of up to 400,000 transactions per second (TPS) and very low latency for consensus commits, around 0.5 seconds. This whitepaper details the architectural design, core features, theory foundations, and performance benefits of Scalaris, providing a comprehensive understanding of its capabilities and advantages.
